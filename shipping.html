                                <p>Once your order is despatched, you will receive an email from us with your tracking number. This will help you track the delivery status of your order. </p>
                                <p>Once an order has left Flat Friends'<sup>&reg;</sup> facility, it is in the hands of the parcel shipment company that 
Flat Friends<sup>&reg;</sup> engages to deliver your order, and Flat Friends<sup>&reg;</sup> is not liable for any errors made by these services.</p>
								<p>Please note that it might not be possible for us to deliver to some locations. If this is the case, we will inform you using the contact details that you provide to us when you make your order and arrange for cancellation of the order or delivery to an alternative delivery address.</p>
								<p>You may grant us an 'authority to leave' when placing your order. If you do, you understand and agree that this 'authority to leave' gives us and/or our selected couriers permission to leave your order unattended at the front door – or, where applicable, at the reception or concierge's desk - of the delivery address without obtaining a signature confirming that delivery is made to you. This will be the same as if you received and signed for receiving the goods you ordered and you understand and agree that by granting us 'authority to leave', we and our couriers are released of all responsibility and liability for your orders delivery, since your order will be left unattended, and this responsibility and liability for proof of delivery is transferred to you once your goods are dropped off as per your instructions.</p>

                            	<p>We aim to deliver within the time indicated by us at the time your order is despatched and you are provided with a tracking number. </p>
								<p>We cannot promise an exact delivery date when you submit your order, nor when we confirm your order. Your tracking number will give you an ability to track the whereabouts of your order while it is in 
transit.</p>
								<p>We make every effort to deliver within 3 working days from the date of any confirmation of your order for orders within Australia and 14 days for international deliveries but we cannot guarantee any firm delivery dates. Where this is not possible, we will notify you and, unless we state otherwise, ensure that your products are delivered within 28 - 45 days from acceptance. </p>
								<p>We shall aim to let you know if we expect that we are unable to meet our estimated delivery date, but, to the extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable to you for any losses, liabilities, costs, damages, charges or expenses arising out of late delivery.</p>

                                <p>The estimated delivery time for orders within Australia is 1-3 business days after shipment. </p>
								<p>Your orders are shipped using Post or a Courier company depending on urgency and cost. </p>
								<p>Each parcel is able to be traced and requires a signature upon delivery. If you cannot be present at the delivery time, then please leave a message (using the ordering process at the check-out stage) giving permission for your parcel to be left in a secure place without a signature 'authority to leave' please remember this releases us from all liability if you do not receive your order. Otherwise, a note will be left and you will be required to pick up the package. To confirm shipping times and track your order, use your tracking number and follow the instructions as shown by the shipping company.</p>
								<p>Any guarantees or representations made as to delivery times are subject to any delays resulting from postal delays, couriers delaying the order in transit, or force majeure for which we will not be responsible.</p>
                                <p>INTERNATIONAL</p>
                                <p>For international orders, you may have the option to select Standard or Express delivery services.</p>
                                <p>Standard Delivery is not available to all counties and this is something outside Flat Friends'<sup>&reg;</sup> control.</p> 
								<p>If Standard Delivery is not available to your country, you must select the Express Delivery shipping option. In some countries, customs or import duties may be charged. These charges must be paid by you when you pick-up or receive your parcel. We have no control over these charges and cannot provide an estimate of what they may be. </p>
								<p>Customs policies vary widely from country to country, please contact your local customs office for further information. </p>
								<p>Please note, the International Courier will not deliver to a PO BOX address. Please use a residential address, or work address where you will be available to sign for your parcel.</p>
                                <p>ECONOMY EXPRESS DELIVERY - INTERNATIONAL</p>
								<p>The estimated delivery time is 1-3 weeks after shipment. Once your parcel has arrived in your country, standard shipping parcels will be passed on to the internal postal service, according to standard delivery procedures.</p>
								<p>For deliveries, we suggest you have your order delivered to a work address rather than a home address, as our couriers only deliver between 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday, and will require a signature on receipt. If you aren't available when your parcel is delivered, the delivery driver will leave a calling card with instructions on how to pick it up.</p>
								<p>SPECIAL EXPRESS DELIVERY - INTERNATIONAL</p>
								<p>The estimated delivery time is 2-5 business days after shipment depending on location. </p>
								<p>All overseas parcels will be marked at full value as is legally required.</p>
								<p>The International Courier will try delivering for 3 consecutive business days. If unsuccessful, the International Courier Service will notify us to seek instructions or destroy your parcel. We cannot be held accountable for any packages destroyed by the International Courier Company.</p>

If you wish us to redeliver the products to you, you will need to authorise us to charge your credit/debit card for re-delivery. If we do not hear from you within 28 days, we will cancel your order and refund your payment to you less any reasonable delivery charges we have incurred.</p>
								<p>If delivery or collection is delayed through your unreasonable refusal to accept delivery or if you do not, within two weeks of our first attempt to deliver your order to you accept delivery or collect your order from the carrier, then we may, without affecting any other right or remedy available to us, do either or both of the following:</p>
								<ul class="indent">
                                	<li>(a) charge you for our reasonable storage fee and other costs reasonably incurred by us; or</li>
									<li>(b) no longer make your order available for delivery or collection and notify you that we are immediately cancelling the applicable Contract, in which case we will refund your credit or debit card as applicable any money already paid to us under the applicable Contract, less our reasonable administration charges including for attempting to deliver and then returning the Product, and any storage fees.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>When you return the product to us, we will at our discretion decide not to repair, replace or refund you for the Product and/or we may require you to pay all reasonable carriage costs and servicing costs at our current standard fees and costs and charge this to your credit or debit card, or the payment details that you provided to us when you made your Order, and, to the extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable to you for any losses, liabilities, costs, damages, charges or expenses as a result.</p>
